It is important to note that all analyses reported in the papaer were conducted using imputed data to retain the full sample in the multiple linear regression model. Excluding participants with missing data would have resulted in the removal of 13 participants (12 females and 1 male), leading to a significant reduction in sample size. To evaluate the impact of imputation, we performed parallel analyses with and without imputed data (here you can find results of this analisis). The comparison revealed some differences in the female multiple regression analysis when using imputed versus non-imputed data. In the analysis without imputed data, the AIC procedure for the multiple regression model suggested including STEM as a predictor while excluding femininity and masculinity. In the final model without imputed data, EA2 (emotional arousal after the emotion regulation task) emerged as the strongest negative predictor of accuracy, with the NCL group performing worse than the IUD groupâ€”consistent with the results from the analysis with imputed data. However, unlike the imputed data analysis, the NCF and OC groups were not significant predictors. Instead, STEM became a positive predictor of accuracy.
We hypothesize that these differences may be influenced by the biased exclusion of STEM and non-STEM participants due to missing data in specific groups. For example, in the OC group, 2 STEM and 1 non-STEM participant were excluded, while in the NCF group, 4 non-STEM and 1 STEM participant were removed. This selective exclusion could have altered the composition of the sample and influenced the results. Based on these findings, we conclude that data imputation was a justified approach. It not only preserved the full sample size but also enabled more robust and representative findings by mitigating the potential biases introduced by the exclusion of participants
